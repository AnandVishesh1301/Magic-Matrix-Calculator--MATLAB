# Magic-Matrix-Calculator--MATLAB
The code asks the user to specify what order of matrix and how many of
them they want. It then generates that number of square matrices randomly.
It then calculates the value of a specific number N, based on the order of
the matrix(n). It then finds ou how many magic and semi magic arrays are
generated in them It also finds the value of magic rows and magic columns
wihtin them .
